* MOM for the =dataservice= code review
 
 Code review was done in two parts. One on [2015-08-27 Thu] at 4:00
 p.m and other on [2015-08-28 Fri] at 11:30 a.m. The test cases are
 yet to be reviewed. Following are the changes suggested:

** In Developer entity :
1. Change DeveloperId --> Id
2. Under the mutable data section - InstituteId can be represented as
   institute.id or institute --> id
3. Add angular brackets in the "Signature Of Constructor"
4. Correct the constructor for mandatory fields
5. DeveloperId would also change in the methods
6. In =getAllDevelopers= remove =.to_client= so that only list of
   objects is returned. This is true for all other entities too.
7. Setter methods to include save()

** In Technology entity :
1. TechnologyId --> Id
2. Technology name should be mentioned in mutable data
3. Since it is mutable, use =set_name()= in constructor
4. =getAllTechnologies= - same as point 6 of =Developer= entity
5. Setter methods to include save()

** In Experiment entity :
1. Write name as part of the mutable data
2. Change type of =Experiment= name from =Name= to =String=
3. =get_experiment= becomes =get_by_id=
4. =ExperimentId= becomes just =Id=
5. New methods to add are:
    set_name, get_name, add_technology, remove_technology
6. self.technologies = kwargs['technology'] is wrong and check if
   input is a list first and then each item belongs =Technology= class
7. Include lab in experiment constructor and make it mandatory , also
   describe it in documentation
8. Correct test case for =get_lab=
9. Include save() in setters for data persistence

** In Lab entity : 

1. Change LabId --> Id
2. Change Mnemonic --> LabId
3. =No. of expts= is a function and not an attribute, so remove this
   from immutable data and definition
4. Add =remarks= and =status= as part of mutable data
5. Remove slug
6. Use =set_name= in constructor
7. Include =no_of_labs= just like =no_of_experiments=
8. Change in documentation : =setisweb2compliant= to =isweb2compliant=
 
** DONE In Institute and Discipline entities :
1. Change entity id to just =Id= and =mnemonic= to EntityId
   everywhere - in documentation as well as in methods
2. Change =get_entity_by_id= to =get_by_id= and
   =get_entity_by_mnemonic= to =get_by_entityid=
3. Modify signature by including angular brackets
4. Add name as part of the mutable data
5. Discipline name shouldn't be of type =Name= but of type
   =String=. Same for =Institute= too

** DONE Remove =Version= from types
** DONE Remove =InstituteName= and make respective change in =Institute= entity too 
** DONE Give links in =Email= and =URL=
** DONE Change the definition of =Integration Level=
** The name attribute of Integration Level and Hosting Platform should be unique
** Change org-templates (low priority)

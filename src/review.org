** [2015-08-28 Fri]

  Code review was done in two parts. One on [2015-08-27 Thu] at 4:00
  p.m and other on [2015-08-28 Fri] at 11:30 a.m. The test cases are
  yet to be reviewed. Following are the changes suggested:

*** In Developer entity :
1. Change DeveloperId --> Id
2. Under the mutable data section - InstituteId can be represented as
   institute.id or institute --> id
3. Add angular brackets in the "Signature Of Constructor"
4. Correct the constructor for mandatory fields
5. DeveloperId would also change in the methods
6. In =getAllDevelopers= remove =.to_client= so that only list of
   objects is returned. This is true for all other entities too.
7. Setter methods to include save()

*** In Technology entity :
1. TechnologyId --> Id
2. Technology name should be mentioned in mutable data
3. Since it is mutable, use =set_name()= in constructor
4. =getAllTechnologies= - same as point 6 of =Developer= entity
5. Setter methods to include save()

*** In Experiment entity :
1. Write name as part of the mutable data
2. Change type of =Experiment= name from =Name= to =String=
3. =get_experiment= becomes =get_by_id=
4. =ExperimentId= becomes just =Id=
5. New methods to add are:
    set_name, get_name, add_technology, remove_technology
6. self.technologies = kwargs['technology'] is wrong and check if
   input is a list first and then each item belongs =Technology= class
7. Include lab in experiment constructor and make it mandatory , also
   describe it in documentation
8. Correct test case for =get_lab=
9. Include save() in setters for data persistence

*** In Lab entity : 

1. Use =set_name= in constructor
2. Include =no_of_labs= just like =no_of_experiments=
3. Change in documentation : =setisweb2compliant= to =isweb2compliant=
4. Change LabId --> Id
5. Change Mnemonic --> LabId
6. =No. of expts= is a function and not an attribute, so remove this
   from immutable data and definition
7. Add =remarks= and =status= as part of mutable data
8. Remove slug
   
*** In Institute and Discipline entities :
1. Change entity id to just =Id= and =mnemonic= to EntityId
   everywhere - in documentation as well as in methods
2. Change =get_entity_by_id= to =get_by_id= and
   =get_entity_by_mnemonic= to =get_by_entityid=
3. Modify signature by including angular brackets
4. Add name as part of the mutable data
5. Discipline name shouldn't be of type =Name= but of type
   =String=. Same for =Institute= too

*** Remove =Version= from types
*** Remove =InstituteName= and make respective change in =Institute= entity too 
*** Give links in =Email= and =URL=
*** Change the definition of =Integration Level=
*** The name attribute of Integration Level and Hosting Platform should be unique
*** Change org-templates (low priority)

 - =Code-review= folder to be deleted from =src= and replaced with
   =review.org=.

 - Remove =LabId=, =InstituteId= and =DisciplineId= as =Types= since
   they no longer represent natural numbers.

 - In the constructors of various entities, move =name= after the
   =entity_id=.  This is done as a temporary solution for now to avoid
   IntegrityErrors.

 - Error Handling for duplicate values needs to be done.  For example,
   the constructor for =Institute= can throw an error if one tries to
   create two objects with the same value of the field =institute_id=.
   In the current scenario this is not possible since it is an
   immutable field.

 - We can also think of assigning EntityIds like =institute_id= as
   unique. 
 
 - Also, saving to the database can be a one time thing done at the
   end of the constructor, rather than saving repeatedly through
   setter methods.
